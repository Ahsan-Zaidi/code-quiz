## Description

🔍Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

I have created a coding quiz with the purpose of checking the users knowledge on Javascript.

✋ [GitHub Repository] https://github.com/Ahsan-Zaidi/code-quiz


✋ [Deployed App] https://ahsan-zaidi.github.io/code-quiz/


## ✋User Story

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

## ✋Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I click the start button THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over THEN I can save my initials and score
